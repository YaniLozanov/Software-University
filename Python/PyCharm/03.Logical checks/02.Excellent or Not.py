# Problem:
# The next task of this topic is to write a console program that introduces an estimate (decimal number)
# and prints "Excellent!" if the score is 5.50 or higher, or "Not Excellent." in the opposite case.


grade = float(input())

if grade >= 5.50:
    print("Excellent!")

else:
    print("Not excellent.")
